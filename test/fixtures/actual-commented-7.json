This plan will not have any trial, but other limits of the eduTrial plan still apply. \nAdditionally, we sometimes need to be able change the user limit for an eduOrg plan. In Zed, we should be able to find that org and set any user limit and apply it to that org. This should only be possible for orgs on the new eduOrg plan.      \n < https://codio.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/user/joelmoss >Joel Moss:< https://bitbucket.org/codio/black-market/pull-requests/30/adds-customizesubscription-api-method/diff > https://bitbucket.org/codio/black-market/pull-requests/30/adds-customizesubscription-api-method/diff \n < https://codio.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/codio-6388#comment=85-4925 >View< https://codio.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/codio-6388?replyTo=85-4925 > Reply                                                                                                                \nYou (flowdockbot) received this message because you had enabled notifications for: Board (codio) Backlog, In Progress, Everything in Project Codio, Roadmap (codio) Backlog saved searches.< https://codio.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/user/flowdockbot?tabId=Filters+and+Notifications > Notification settings.
